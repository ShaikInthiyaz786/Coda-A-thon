''' 40. Write a program to print all the two digit numbers, where the second digit
is smaller than its first by 4 , and if the number was divided by the digits
sum , the quotient would be 7.'''

# first_Digit = x
# second_Digit = x-4
# number = 10x + x - 4

# (11*x-4 )/ (2*x-4) = 7
x = 24 / 3

print(x)
print(x-4)
print(10*x + x - 4)
