'''41.Bacteria are known to multiply very rapidly. If a certain container contains
just one bacterium on the first day and there are twice as many on the
next day. In this manner the number of bacteria in the container doubles
everyday. Assuming that the container would be full on the 10th day. With
13,312 bacteria, find the number of bacteria that was initially in the
container on the first day.'''
